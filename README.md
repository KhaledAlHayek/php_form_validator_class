# php_form_validator_class

## to edit and run this file
you need to run **npm install** to install all the dependencies required for this project

## why you need to run commands
because **node_modules** folder is too large wnad will take too long if you wish to dwonload the folder

### Notice
i used gulp to compile sass into css, if you do not want the style, then copy the validator class
